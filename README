This is an unofficial xarchiver 0.5.3 + all the patches I could find. The patches are from Debian, Fedora, some were created by Teo Box at the sourceforge bug tracker (big thanks to him!), and a couple appeared from nowhere :)

Upstream (a bit inactive): http://sourceforge.net/projects/xarchiver/

If a 0.5.4 official is ever released, this might disappear as it won't be needed anymore.
